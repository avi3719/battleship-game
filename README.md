# battleship-game
This is a battleship game in python, where you can guess at what location your ship is hidden.
In this project we will build a simplified, one-player version of the classic board game Battleship! In this version of the game, 
there will be a single ship hidden in a random location on a 5x5 grid. The player will have 10 guesses to try to sink the ship.
To build this game we will use our knowledge of lists, conditionals and functions in Python.
